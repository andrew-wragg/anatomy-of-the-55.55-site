            To honor 100 years of the luxury brand’s iconic CHANEL N°5 fragrance, Patrice Leguéreau, 
            director of the Fine Jewelry Creation Studio and master jeweler, has imagined an exquisite 
            and incomparable collection of 123 pieces, the “Collection N°5.” As part of this assemblage, 
            he was inspired to create a singular necklace, a work of meticulous craftsmanship and beauty 
            that interprets the eternal mystery of the legendary perfume.

              In 1921, Gabrielle Chanel charged perfumer Ernest Beaux with developing a modern fragrance 
              to showcase the multifaceted nature of femininity.

            This boundary-breaking scent — which combined more than 80 ingredients, including synthetic 
            aldehydes — was a huge departure from the one-note floral concoctions popularized by society 
            women of the time. And its name? A tribute to Chanel’s favorite number: 5. As fate would have it, 
            her favored scent medley was Beaux’s fifth sample. And the visionary couturier would extend her 
            luck by introducing the avant-garde fragrance, which ultimately became a best-seller worldwide, 
            on the fifth day of the fifth month of that year.<br/>
            In 1932, Chanel once again shattered the codes of French High Jewelry with her one and only collection 
            in platinum and diamonds. These “Bijoux de Diamants” introduced new ways of wearing adornments and took 
            jewelry into another realm.

                “Gabrielle Chanel approached the universes of fragrances and jewelry with the same visionary 
                values, focusing on audacity and the quest of excellence. I wanted to rediscover that creative 
                gesture with this collection.”

                The classic glass flacon features elegant, clean lines with a monochromatic white label and chic 
                black lettering. Leguéreau was inspired by the perfume decanter’s beloved design and envisioned a 
                magnificent necklace that shared its silhouette.

                To create a visual impact worthy of the fragrance’s culture-defining legacy, Leguéreau had the 
                idea for an impeccable, Flawless Type IIa 55.55-carat center diamond.

            The gem’s weight is a calculated homage to the designer’s lucky number and is inspired by 
            the shape of the bottle’s stopper, a design that reflects the famous Place Vendôme in 
            Paris — also home to the Ritz, where Chanel resided.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-in">
            The revolutionary fragrance’s heady and alluring aroma encompasses a highly complex 
            blend of aldehydes, including an intricately assembled mélange of delicious florals 
            like ylang-ylang, May rose and jasmine. They are layered over a warm, woody base of 
            vanilla, vetiver, amber, patchouli and sandalwood. To bring these elements to life, 
            the distinct bottle-shaped motif of the necklace features tailor-cut diamonds of 
            varying proportions. Each stone represents a separate floral note of the eau’s unique 
            bouquet. The striking gems are complemented by a waterfall of pear-shaped diamonds 
            that evoke the liquid effect of perfume drops.

            The most potent asset of the venerable scent is its sillage, the floating essence a 
            perfume leaves as its wearer moves across a room. And just as CHANEL N°5 leaves an 
            indelible impression that has influenced our culture over the past 100 years, this 
            exquisitely curated necklace was designed to be a long-standing and grand honor of the 
            fragrance’s centennial. The eye-catching gems of the 55.55 necklace diffuse light like 
            a breezy, ethereal aroma. Its sprays of scintillating stones summon thoughts of the 
            fragrance’s dazzling olfactory burst. Each jewel was hand-selected to be reminiscent of 
            the scent’s complexity, collectively giving the statement piece unparalleled radiance.
